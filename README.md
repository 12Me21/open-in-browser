chrome/edge extension which removes `content-disposition` headers from http responses
(if this header is set to "attachment", the file will be downloaded rather than displayed in the browser)
Similar to the "open in browser" addon for firefox, but with less features probably...

Code is based on the "Modify Content-Type" chrome extension
